This is an updated version of my [Memory Palace React Application](https://github.com/stlewis/my-memory-palace). It has feature-parity with the previous version but it's far better organized, having been bootstrapped from the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) utility. You can find a working version of the application [here](http://memory.decodingsteve.com).
